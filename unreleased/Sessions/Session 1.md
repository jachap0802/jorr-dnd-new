As the civilian longship creaks and groans, it settles into the bustling harbor of Braun. The sky has shifted into a muddled shade of grey, rain pouring down in relentless sheets that soak the worn wooden docks and drench the civilians from distant lands. The air is thick with the smell of salt and damp earth, mingling with the distant cries of gulls circling above. As you step off the ship, your boots splash into puddles that ripple beneath the weight of your arrival. Knights in polished armor stand at the ship's edge, their presence both reassuring and imposing, guiding the disembarking civilians with a steady hand.

Around you, a tapestry of cultures unfolds—familiar faces mix with strangers, their voices rising into a chaotic symphony of curiosity, concern, and confusion. Merchants shout their wares, while families embrace amidst the downpour, all weaving together the vibrant life of the harbor.

Yet beneath this bustling arrival lies a deeper truth, one yet to be revealed. Time passes since the initial landing, the sounds of laughter and chatter filling the air, until suddenly a grizzled voice cuts through the cacophony, halting the waves of conversation.

“Attention! May I have everyone’s undivided attention, please!”

The crowd falls silent, their curiosity piqued, as they turn to gather around a marble stone fountain at the center of the square. There, an older man stands, his presence commanding and resolute. He is clad in heavy steel armor that glistens under the relentless rain, the clinks and clatters echoing softly as he shifts his weight. The water from the fountain cascades around him, creating a stark contrast to the tension in the air, as the gathered citizens await his words with bated breath.

The knights in which had guided the civilians off the longship suddenly stand in attention around the crowd, awaiting the words from the man in question.

"I am the head of the Lion Military Faction of Falsia, General Citratus. I would like to greet each and every one of you, and thank you for your attendance, and gratitude. It is my honor, to welcome you."

"To Falsia."

Suddenly, the sharp sound of spears striking the wet mud echoes around you, reverberating off the harbor walls as the surrounding guards come to attention. Their voices rise in unison, chanting a proud national anthem that fills the air with a sense of solidarity and purpose. The rhythmic thud of their spear butts against the ground blends with the rain, creating a powerful symphony that commands the attention of everyone present.

"Krus de Falsia!" (Pride to Falsia)
"Krus de Falsia!" (Pride to Falsia)
"Krus de Falsia!" (Pride to Falsia)

The guards chant in powerful unison, their voices resonating off the harbor walls, instilling a sense of pride and unity among the crowd. After the third chant, the imposing figure of Citratus raises a hand, signaling the guards to halt. Instantly, the fervor of the moment dissipates, leaving the civilians enveloped in an uncomfortable silence. The rain continues to pour, but the sound of it now feels muted, awaiting what comes next.

“Citizens of distant lands, you stand here today not by mere chance, but by design. You have been summoned by the Republic of Falsia to serve in a matter of utmost secrecy. There are whispers of treachery—an assassination planned against one of our own, by a hand loyal to Falsia. We cannot trust this matter to our own, for corruption may already grip those closest to the heart of power.”

He pauses, scanning the faces before him.

“Each of you has been chosen because your loyalties lie beyond our borders. You are to serve as the jury, not of law, but of investigation. Spies, in all but name. You will be divided into groups, each bound by a number assigned to you at random. Those with the same number shall work together, and only together, as a unit. In groups of eight, you will uncover the truth, for only then can you ensure that justice prevails. Trust your group, trust the task, and trust in the honor of this land. Failure is not an option.”

He gestures to the guards, who step forward with scrolls containing the numbers.

“Your assignments await. Choose wisely and tread carefully. The future of Falsia may depend on you.”

As Citratus finishes speaking, the guards who had stood at attention line the civilians up into single file. They are led toward shacks, where tall, imposing elves stand, their faces hidden beneath deep hoods. The elves move with an unsettling calm, their presence chilling. As each civilian approaches, one elf extends a bony hand, their voice barely a whisper:

"Your... text... Sir..." they hiss, handing over a small slip of paper with a slow, deliberate motion.

"NEXT," they bark sharply, without looking up, as the next citizen steps forward.

Here’s a description of how the PCs receive their numbers, emphasizing the mysterious and tense atmosphere as their fates are decided:

---

As you all stand in line, the sound of rain pattering on the rooftops mixes with the dull murmur of the crowd. One by one, you step forward to the front of the shack, where the tall, hooded elves await. Their bony hands extend slowly, offering each of you a small, damp slip of paper. The elf you approach doesn’t even glance up, their voice low and unsettling as they utter the same words over and over.

“Your... text... Sir... NEXT.”

You take the slip and carefully unfold it, the ink slightly smudged by the rain. A single number stares back at you. You glance around and notice a few others also examining their slips of paper, their expressions hidden beneath furrowed brows or cloaked hoods. Some seem confused, others curious.

As you gather at the marble fountain, a handful of others nearby hold up the same number as you. Eight in total. Slowly, eyes meet, and though the circumstances are grim, there’s an unspoken understanding that these are the people you’ll be working with.

The guards watch closely as each citizen receives their number, their eyes sharp beneath their helmets, ensuring no one breaks the silence of this unusual ceremony. Around you, other groups begin to form, each as unfamiliar with one another as you are with your new companions.

You stand there, surrounded by strangers, yet bound by the same purpose. The weight of this slip of paper is heavier than it seems. Whatever lies ahead, you will face it together.

As the last few citizens receive their slips of paper, Citratus steps forward once more, his presence commanding the crowd’s attention. His voice, sharp and authoritative, cuts through the sound of the rain.

"Now that you all have been marked with your numbers, I will reveal what your roles will be in this grand matter. Not all of you are here for the same task. Some of you will serve in advisory positions, others as protectors, and others still as enforcers. But only one group will be trusted with the most critical mission—the role of spies.”

A tense silence falls over the crowd, the anticipation thick in the air as Citratus’s words echo through the space.

“The jury chosen to act as our spies will hold the number... three."

He pauses for effect, allowing the gravity of his words to settle over the crowd.

"Those bearing this number will be our eyes and ears, working in secrecy to uncover the truth behind the treachery that threatens Falsia. You have been chosen because you are unknown to our enemies, and your loyalty lies beyond our borders. You must trust in each other, for the path ahead will be fraught with danger and deception.”

Around you, murmurs begin to rise as the civilians anxiously glance at their slips of paper. A few looks dart toward you as you glance down to find the number **three** etched onto your own slip.

You lock eyes with the others around you—those bearing the same number. Your group has been chosen, bound together by fate and now by duty. Citratus watches closely, his gaze unwavering, as if already measuring your worth.

“Those with the number three," Citratus continues, "step forward and gather together. You will receive further instructions soon. The rest of you will be notified of your roles in due time. May Falsia stand strong through your service.”

Citratus surveys the crowd, his eyes sharp and piercing. His voice rises above the quiet murmurs that have spread throughout the group.

"Now," he says, his tone leaving no room for hesitation, "those bearing the number three, step forward."

There’s a brief pause, the crowd holding its breath. Slowly, you feel the weight of your own number slip pressing against your palm. Around you, a few others shift nervously, each of them glancing down at their slips, just as you do. You’re not alone.

One by one, individuals with the number three etched onto their slips step forward. As you move through the gathering, you notice others doing the same. A tall figure with a brooding presence, another with a look of quiet intensity, and still more who seem both cautious and determined.

You’re now standing side by side, your fellow jurors, though strangers to you in this moment, will soon become your allies in a matter of life and death. The rain continues to fall, running down the faces of those around you, but none of you flinch or hesitate now.

Citratus watches the small group form, his expression unreadable, his eyes flicking over each of you with an almost clinical precision. Once satisfied, he steps forward once more.

“These are your chosen spies," he declares, his voice booming across the harbor. "You will move as one, relying on each other to see this through. Falsia will depend on your silence, your strength, and your ability to act without fear or favor."

He steps back, allowing a moment to pass, the tension thick between you all. Each person, different in background, skill, and experience, is now linked by this moment of stepping forward—chosen to be part of a mission that will shape the fate of Falsia.

-- Character Questions and interaction can happen in this time, shortly before the next scene --

As the sun begins to set, casting a golden hue over the city of Falsia, the chosen spies find themselves in a dimly lit room within a nearby tavern, their temporary haven before the masquerade at the mansion. A flickering candle casts dancing shadows across the walls, revealing a small collection of clothing laid out on a rough wooden table.

"All right, everyone," says one of you, a mixture of excitement and nerves in your voice. “Tonight, we blend in. We need to look the part.”

The garments before you range from elegant dresses and tailored suits to cloaks adorned with subtle embellishments that speak of wealth and status. Each piece is designed to ensure you move seamlessly among the upper crust of Falsian society.

The sun begins to set on the harbor, as the PCs begin to dress for the occasion, and talk amongst themselves. 

## The Mystery of Thorne Manor

Victim: Valerian Thorne


Valerian Thorn was born into a family of modest means but quickly rose through the ranks of Falsia's political system due to his sharp intellect and undeniable charm. Throughout his rise, his closest childhood friend, Aric Hale, followed a similar path. The two had once shared dreams of leading Falsia into a new era of prosperity, but as they grew older, their political ideologies began to diverge.

While Valerian was idealistic in his younger years, Aric became more pragmatic and ruthless, using any means necessary to secure power. Though still maintaining a public friendship, their relationship became fraught with competition. Political factions grew around them, and the rivalry that had once been friendly turned dark.

**

Under increasing political pressure from Aric, Valerian felt the weight of his rival’s growing influence. Aric, now a powerful and cunning politician, had been leveraging alliances and making shadowy deals with various factions to secure his dominance. Fearing that he would lose everything to his childhood rival, Valerian made a desperate choice: he joined a secret cult that promised him the resources and influence needed to surpass Aric.

But this decision haunted Valerian. As his involvement deepened, he discovered the cult’s dark side—human experiments, forbidden magic, and the sacrifice of innocent lives. Worse still, he realized Aric might have known about the cult all along and had subtly nudged him into joining, hoping to corrupt or destroy Valerian's reputation.

**

One fateful night, Valerian stumbled upon one of the cult’s horrific rituals. Children were being sacrificed, and twisted magic flowed freely. His conscience couldn’t bear the weight of what he had become complicit in. Valerian’s guilt and fear pushed him to a breaking point. He resolved to expose the cult’s evil deeds, but he knew that doing so would also mean revealing his own involvement, likely leading to his downfall.

This party would be his moment of redemption, a final stand to reveal the truth about the cult—and perhaps, implicate Aric as well, though he could not prove his rival’s connection just yet.

**

## Suspects


### 1. Aric Hale

- Role: Rival and childhood friend of Valerian Thorn.
    
- Motive: Aric is deeply concerned for Valerian’s safety but also stands to gain politically if Valerian is out of the picture. His inner conflict between friendship and rivalry makes him a complex character.
    
- Involvement: Innocent of the murder, Aric might still be hiding vital information to protect his own reputation.
    

### 2. Marion Callis

- Role: Head of security at the mansion.
    
- Motive: Paid off by the cult to overlook their activities, Marion fears losing her position if Valerian reveals their dealings.

### 3. Saphira Drenn

- Role: Valerian’s personal assistant.
    
- Motive: Feeling betrayed by Valerian’s hidden dealings with the cult, Saphira fears that any exposure will ruin her life and career.

### 4. Eramis Frostclaw

- Role: Aristocrat with deep ties to Falsia’s high society.
    
- Motive: Eramis has secret business ties to the cult, and Valerian’s exposure would jeopardize his interests and status.
    
- Involvement: Although he didn't murder Valerian directly, he could be complicit in covering up the cult's actions.
    

### 5. The High Council Member (Secret PC)

- Role: A member of the cult's high council.
    
- Motive: Tasked with ensuring that the cult's activities remain hidden and that their identity is protected, they may feel torn between loyalty to the cult and the PCs.
    
- Involvement: This character is integral to the cover-up, tampering with evidence, and influencing events from within the group. They could also be used to shift suspicion onto others while keeping their own identity secret.
    

### 6. Cecilia Wren

- Role: A renowned gossip columnist known for her connections within the upper echelons of Falsian society.
    
- Motive: Cecilia thrives on scandal and would benefit from a sensational story. If Valerian’s expose leads to a political uproar, it would give her column a major boost and ensure her relevance in society.
    
- Involvement: While not directly involved in the murder, Cecilia could have been privy to information that implicates various parties. She may have inadvertently spread rumors that heightened tensions among the suspects.
    

### 7. Gaius Blackthorn

- Role: An influential merchant with deep ties to both the government and the underbelly of Falsian society.
    
- Motive: Gaius has financial dealings that would be adversely affected by Valerian’s revelations about the cult. He seeks to maintain his wealth and influence, and eliminating Valerian would serve as a means to that end.
    
- Involvement: Gaius could be seen as a key player in the events leading up to the murder, possibly even having the means to arrange it without getting his hands dirty directly.
    

## Killer/s, Accomplice/s

### Eramis Frostclaw

**Role:** Crime boss posing as Falsia's arms dealer.  
**Background:** Eramis is a well-known figure in Falsia's high society, reputed for his lavish parties and influential connections. Underneath this polished exterior lies a cunning criminal mastermind who controls the underbelly of the city. He supplies the government with weapons and gear, maintaining a façade of loyalty to the state while secretly aligning himself with the cult to further his interests.

**Motive:** Eramis fears that Valerian’s planned exposure of the cult will not only jeopardize his illicit dealings but also his position of power. If Valerian succeeds in revealing the cult's activities, it could lead to increased scrutiny of his own operations, risking everything he has built.

**Involvement:** While he may not have directly committed the murder, Eramis is heavily involved in orchestrating the events leading up to it. He could have facilitated the murder through hired muscle or provided resources for the killer. Additionally, his close ties with the cult provide him with insider information, allowing him to manipulate events from the shadows to serve his agenda.
