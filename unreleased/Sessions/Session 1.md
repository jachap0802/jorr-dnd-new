As the civilian longship creaks and groans, it settles into the bustling harbor of Braun. The sky has shifted into a muddled shade of grey, rain pouring down in relentless sheets that soak the worn wooden docks and drench the civilians from distant lands. The air is thick with the smell of salt and damp earth, mingling with the distant cries of gulls circling above. As you step off the ship, your boots splash into puddles that ripple beneath the weight of your arrival. Knights in polished armor stand at the ship's edge, their presence both reassuring and imposing, guiding the disembarking civilians with a steady hand.

Around you, a tapestry of cultures unfolds—familiar faces mix with strangers, their voices rising into a chaotic symphony of curiosity, concern, and confusion. Merchants shout their wares, while families embrace amidst the downpour, all weaving together the vibrant life of the harbor.

Yet beneath this bustling arrival lies a deeper truth, one yet to be revealed. Time passes since the initial landing, the sounds of laughter and chatter filling the air, until suddenly a grizzled voice cuts through the cacophony, halting the waves of conversation.

“Attention! May I have everyone’s undivided attention, please!”

The crowd falls silent, their curiosity piqued, as they turn to gather around a marble stone fountain at the center of the square. There, an older man stands, his presence commanding and resolute. He is clad in heavy steel armor that glistens under the relentless rain, the clinks and clatters echoing softly as he shifts his weight. The water from the fountain cascades around him, creating a stark contrast to the tension in the air, as the gathered citizens await his words with bated breath.

The knights in which had guided the civilians off the longship suddenly stand in attention around the crowd, awaiting the words from the man in question.

"I am the head of the Lion Military Faction of Falsia, General Citratus. I would like to greet each and every one of you, and thank you for your attendance, and gratitude. It is my honor, to welcome you."

"To Falsia."

Suddenly, the sharp sound of spears striking the wet mud echoes around you, reverberating off the harbor walls as the surrounding guards come to attention. Their voices rise in unison, chanting a proud national anthem that fills the air with a sense of solidarity and purpose. The rhythmic thud of their spear butts against the ground blends with the rain, creating a powerful symphony that commands the attention of everyone present.

"Krus de Falsia!" (Pride to Falsia)
"Krus de Falsia!" (Pride to Falsia)
"Krus de Falsia!" (Pride to Falsia)

The guards chant in powerful unison, their voices resonating off the harbor walls, instilling a sense of pride and unity among the crowd. After the third chant, the imposing figure of Citratus raises a hand, signaling the guards to halt. Instantly, the fervor of the moment dissipates, leaving the civilians enveloped in an uncomfortable silence. The rain continues to pour, but the sound of it now feels muted, awaiting what comes next.

"We stand today, in the shadow of tragedy that has befallen our great nation. A young boy--innocent and full of promise, was cruelly taken from us. This heinous act is not merely a stain on our honor; it is a failure of justice that reflects upon us all."

"As a proud servant of Falsia, I feel this burden acutely. Our nation, known for its integrity and strength, has been tested in the most harrowing of ways. It is a disgrace that such a crime could occur within our borders, enough to gather, and inconvenience all of you. And for that, I must apologize."
