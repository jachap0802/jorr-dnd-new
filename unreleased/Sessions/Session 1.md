Our first session takes place on the harbor of Braun, with our protagonists, as well as citizens from across the lands of Jorr, all coming onto the harbor from a longship, arriving from a long trip to the Republic of Falsia. Once arriving, the head of the Lion Regime of the Falsian military, Citratus, announces that these citizens have been called here for a special duty, in which will be rewarded handsomely. The citizens line up, including our playable characters, and are each given a number, our playable characters all having the number "3", getting their papers from dark figures in the shacks. Citratus then announced the means of the gathering of citizens, to investigate a possible hit on a high government official of Falsia, Valerian Thorne, the mayor of the commonwealth of Falsia. Whoever's number is chosen, will be put in a special group of 7, for the purpose of being spies in an upcoming party celebrating the mayor-elect. 

Once announcing the means of the gathering, Citratus then announces the players, announcing that everyone with the number "3" will be put in the special squad as spies. This 7 people are all of our players, and they are then guided to Garrick's Shed of Trinkets and Mysteries.

Here, they all choose special outfits/costumes to match the occasion of a fancy party. Here is what everyone chooses:

Hungar : Gnome costume, with a red hat along with a monk-like necklace.

Awktooa : An all black suit, with a black tie and black cufflinks

Tenet: A red gnome hat, similar to Hungar's costume but smaller.

Molasses: A mysterious stone ring, with runes along its diameter, with Bjorn's national symbol

Aurelian: A Black suit with a green tie, along with an amulet of mysterious origin, glowing red in certain situations.

Mierda: A bracelet held together by loose string, balls with special runes along each ball.

Gaia: A blue shiny dress, shining against the light

Once they are done dressing up, Hungar goes to see what is taking the guards so long to be taken to the mansion, and sees Garrick talking with two Falsian guards, who give Hungar an interesting look, but continue their work. After this moment, Citratus comes with a carriage, making their way to the mansion.

## The Mystery of Thorne Manor

Our players arrive at the manor, initially introduced by the Manor owner, Valerian Thorne. He greets the guests, feeling very anxious and paranoid, always looking around them, but still keeping a calm demeanor. He leads all of you to the entrance of the manor, introduced by two guards of the manor. They initially cross their arms, but once seeing the guests, open up. They initially confront Molasses, saying his lantern is not allowed within the manor, however, the other characters convince the guards to let him keep it. They agree, and continue forward, until stopped by Marion Callis, the head of security of the Thorne Manor. They are all asked to sign in, however, both Tenet and Aurelian notice a mysterious smudge within the logs of the sign in sheet, listed as the first name on the list, if not erased. Keeping it in mind, our characters continue to the party room of the mansion. Molasses looks at a nearby bookshelf, picking out some books, major ones being, "The Bjorn Empire and it's history", and a book of unknown age and origin, covered in cobwebs. Both Molasses and Tenet keep this in mind, and continue to the party room.

There, they are introduced to the entire party cast. Aric Hale, Saphira Drenn, Cecilia Wren, and Gaius Blackthorn. The players are introduced, and are having a good time, especially Awktooa in Aric Hale's company, as they both chose to drink quite a lot, getting quite drunk in the meantime. Aric starts to grab from a mysterious hole under the floorboards of the room, grabbing what seems to be a large quantity of alcohol. Awktooa drinks with Aric, the both of them becoming quite drunk, with Awktooa falling to the ground. Molasses reads his found books in the corner, Tenet sitting back in a table investigating what is around him. In the distance however, Aurelian chooses to keep a close eye on Aric. Using investigation, he sees a dagger of sorts tied to Aric's waste, with a distinct family crest. He keeps this in mind, and lets Tenet know of this discovery in secret. We move to Hungar, where he begins to question Eramis and who he is. All he mentions is that he is in the trades business. As Tenet is talking with Molasses about the book concerning Bjorn's history, Cecilia comes up to him, wondering what he is doing, as she has not seen or studied the presence of magic. He dismisses these questions and asks what her business is here. Cecilia tells him, and only him, that she is a reporter from the Bjorn empire, looking for a juicy story and information on the Falsian empire. Tenet keeps this in mind. It is during this time, Valerian makes his way back in to the party room, once again saying hi to all his guests. Valerian and Aric embrace in a hug, and Aric asks to talk to Valerian in secret. Hungar chooses to follow, Saphira Drenn, and Eramis all finding the opportunity to leave the room. At this time, the following discoveries are found:

A mysterious conversation between Aric and Valerian.

A mysterious conversation between Valerian and a female voice.

A black box found in a room within the party room, with 2 locks.

Once these pieces of evidence are found, some of our pcs, and all the party guests making their way to the feast room, with the exception of Awktooa, Tenet, Aurelian, and Molasses. When alone, Tenet decides to search the Aric Hale alcohol hole again, discovering:

Two mysterious bottles of alcohol, with a hole in it, but still maintaining liquid. Clearly magical properties.

Switch back to the feast room, Valerian thanks his guests for being there, with Saphira Drenn passing out drinks to the entire room, all sharing a toast. they drink, and share a moment to eat. A couple minutes go by, and Valerian seems to feel ill. He leaves the room, catching the attention of the people still in the party room. Awktooa and Tenet choose to follow Valerian up to the second floor, with Aurelian and Molasses staying on the first to make sure the two don't get caught, hearing Cecilia exiting the food room as well.
\
The two successfully make their way to the second floor, with Tenet making some noise. They hear a slam on one of the doors on the second floor, but not the specific door in which it came from. They search, Awktooa going down the hall to the left, and Tenet staying on the staircase, hearing more people getting out of the feast room to see what is going on. He sends a message to Meirda, giving her information in an argument with Cecilia, pressuring her into giving her more information about her true reason she is here. She stands firm that she is from Falsia. People begin to question this. Before the questioning commences however, it is interrupted by a large scream, and then a thud hitting the floor. Everyone hears this, and starts making their way upstairs. Awktooa and Tenet discover the body in a closet room, and hear the guests coming. Awktooa decided to act drunk as he once did before, saying he was just looking for the bathroom and got lost. Aric, believes him, and guides him downstairs, while the rest of the cast makes their way up. In response, Tenet releases his snake familiar onto the stairs below, attacking the nearest member of the party, Saphira Drenn. She falls back, being consumed by the poison from the familar. Eramis chooses to stay behind and take care of Saphira, with Marion, Cecilia, Gaius, Gaia, Merida, Aurelian, and Molasses making their way upstairs. Hearing them, Tenet searches for any way to hide, to maintain secrecy to avoid being framed for this murder. To stray attention from Tenet, Aurelian casts Thaumaturgy, making a scream like Valerian's voice, but from a different room. The cast goes there and finds the following item:

A sheath of a dagger, with a familiar family crest.

They then return back to the hallways to search, with Hungar attempting to bash the closet door down, with no luck. Marion uses her key to enter the door, seeing the body of Valerian. The following is found around his body:

A key, with a black wood Finish
A dagger, the one Aric had on his waist

In the meantime, Tenet passes by a room with a red gemstone, but dismisses it. He then finds a room with a busted doorknob, able to be open into. He enters, what seems to be Valerian's personal bedroom. On his desk, a note can be seen written in messy ink, with ink being all over the table. The letter reads:

"My dear Saphira,
I apologize, but I need to do what must be done. There is just too much at stake. I can't handle the guilt anymore. Whatever becomes of us, it will be just, and swift. I love you.

Sincerely,
Valerian Thorne"

Tenet took this, and moves downstairs, where everyone had taken the body of Valerian, and have began the investigation. Tenet shows Saphira the note, and states that she knows that this is not Valerian's handwriting, and knows this cannot be him. She is still ill from the poison. Shortly after this, Awktooa requests to investigate the body of Valerian once more, finding the following:

A reciept of trades from Eramis Frostclaw.

Shortly after this,  they begin to question the other suspects, first being Eramis. He states that he knows that Valerian has made dealings with shady people, but that is all he knows. We then go to Aric. He states that he knew of this as well, and knew that he was going to tell everyone about the dealings he had made. But Valerian did not care, and wanted to go forward with it regardless of Aric's advice. He cries and mourns his friend. As this happens, we begin to see Saphira's body convulse and change, glowing immensely with red magic. This stuns Aurelian, Tenet, and causes Molasses' lantern to glow and vibrate immensely. She poofs into an explosion of red energy, leaving only a note of mysterious runes, with the name, ERAMIS, written at the end, with a sigil of a handprint. Aurelian recognizes these runes, and reads the note aloud.

"Do the mission that has been asked of you. We have trained you well, we expect success more than anyone else. Stray their eyes, no one must know of this. Do it, Eramis."

They show this note to Eramis, and he begins to fidget and stutter, obviously nervous. As all of this is happening, Molasses had made a discovery in the next room, a library, and had announced that he had found a statue of sorts. He then grabs the black box, and hovers it over all the suspects, with Marion's waist moving toward the box, as well as the key that was found off of Valerian's body. You all use the two keys, the one found on Valerian, and the one just found on Marion, to open the black box, to discover:

A mysterious paper, that reads:

"A boy lost, who speaks of pain,
this voice learned, from stone in vain
Land of old, will soon be born,
be our pawn, Valerian Thorne."

As this is read, Eramis Frostclaw beams with rays of red energy and light, an explosion of sorts, unlike anything that came before. Molasses' lantern glows brighter than ever before, vibrating to the point where it hits the ground, Molasses losing grip of it for the first time. Aurelian and Tenet fall to the floor, in more pain than they have ever felt before. Eramis' skin begins to peel from his body, revealing a dark elf in a mysterious cloak, holding a dagger similar to the ones you have discovered. He speaks,

"I was wondering when you all would find the truth, you know. Eramis was always a clumsy fool, leaving too much. Oh well, there's only so much we can do. Pawns, all of you, you all are so small, too foolish to look anywhere other than yourselves. Rats. In a cage. You all will bare witness of what is to come, and witness, the might. Of Radiax."

he opens a portal with his dagger, swiping into the space in front of him, revealing a portal to a different location. Before he enters, he takes a look at Aurelian and Tenet, and states.

"You know.. I can see the resemblence."

He goes through the portal, leaving our characters in shock. The gaurds, who were missing, then run into the mansion, confused and scared. The conspiracy grows evermore.


### 3. **Gruff Warrior – Garrick Stonebrow**

- **Description**: A grizzled dwarf with a scar running across his nose and a chipped greataxe strapped to his back. Garrick’s armor is dented and worn, the markings of countless battles etched across its surface.
- **Personality**: Garrick is gruff and straightforward, speaking only when necessary. He radiates confidence and experience, but there’s an air of weariness about him, as if he’s seen too much to be surprised by anything.
- **Motivation**: He’s here because he was ordered by a high-ranking official in the land of Bjorn. He doesn’t care for politics, but he’s not one to disobey orders. He’s mostly here to see what the fuss is about and doesn’t trust the process.

**Possible Dialogue**:  
"Hmph. I’ve fought in wars, and this feels like a battlefield already. Politicians pulling strings… Don’t trust it. Keep your eyes open, and don’t get too comfortable."

---


As you all stand in line, the sound of rain pattering on the rooftops mixes with the dull murmur of the crowd. One by one, you step forward to the front of the shack, where the tall, hooded elves await. Their bony hands extend slowly, offering each of you a small, damp slip of paper. The elf you approach doesn’t even glance up, their voice low and unsettling as they utter the same words over and over.

“Your... text... Sir... NEXT.”

You take the slip and carefully unfold it, the ink slightly smudged by the rain. A single number stares back at you. You glance around and notice a few others also examining their slips of paper, their expressions hidden beneath furrowed brows or cloaked hoods. Some seem confused, others curious.

As you gather at the marble fountain, a handful of others nearby hold up the same number as you. Eight in total. Slowly, eyes meet, and though the circumstances are grim, there’s an unspoken understanding that these are the people you’ll be working with.

The guards watch closely as each citizen receives their number, their eyes sharp beneath their helmets, ensuring no one breaks the silence of this unusual ceremony. Around you, other groups begin to form, each as unfamiliar with one another as you are with your new companions.

You stand there, surrounded by strangers, yet bound by the same purpose. The weight of this slip of paper is heavier than it seems. Whatever lies ahead, you will face it together.

As the last few citizens receive their slips of paper, Citratus steps forward once more, his presence commanding the crowd’s attention. His voice, sharp and authoritative, cuts through the sound of the rain.

"Now that you all have been marked with your numbers, I will reveal what your roles will be in this grand matter. Not all of you are here for the same task. Some of you will serve in advisory positions, others as protectors, and others still as enforcers. But only one group will be trusted with the most critical mission—the role of spies.”

A tense silence falls over the crowd, the anticipation thick in the air as Citratus’s words echo through the space.

“The jury chosen to act as our spies will hold the number... three."

He pauses for effect, allowing the gravity of his words to settle over the crowd.

"Those bearing this number will be our eyes and ears, working in secrecy to uncover the truth behind the treachery that threatens Falsia. You have been chosen because you are unknown to our enemies, and your loyalty lies beyond our borders. You must trust in each other, for the path ahead will be fraught with danger and deception.”

Around you, murmurs begin to rise as the civilians anxiously glance at their slips of paper. A few looks dart toward you as you glance down to find the number **three** etched onto your own slip.

You lock eyes with the others around you—those bearing the same number. Your group has been chosen, bound together by fate and now by duty. Citratus watches closely, his gaze unwavering, as if already measuring your worth.

“Those with the number three," Citratus continues, "step forward and gather together. You will receive further instructions soon. The rest of you will be notified of your roles in due time. May Falsia stand strong through your service.”

Citratus surveys the crowd, his eyes sharp and piercing. His voice rises above the quiet murmurs that have spread throughout the group.

"Now," he says, his tone leaving no room for hesitation, "those bearing the number three, step forward."

There’s a brief pause, the crowd holding its breath. Slowly, you feel the weight of your own number slip pressing against your palm. Around you, a few others shift nervously, each of them glancing down at their slips, just as you do. You’re not alone.

One by one, individuals with the number three etched onto their slips step forward. As you move through the gathering, you notice others doing the same. A tall figure with a brooding presence, another with a look of quiet intensity, and still more who seem both cautious and determined.

You’re now standing side by side, your fellow jurors, though strangers to you in this moment, will soon become your allies in a matter of life and death. The rain continues to fall, running down the faces of those around you, but none of you flinch or hesitate now.

Citratus watches the small group form, his expression unreadable, his eyes flicking over each of you with an almost clinical precision. Once satisfied, he steps forward once more.

“These are your chosen spies," he declares, his voice booming across the harbor. "You will move as one, relying on each other to see this through. Falsia will depend on your silence, your strength, and your ability to act without fear or favor."

He steps back, allowing a moment to pass, the tension thick between you all. Each person, different in background, skill, and experience, is now linked by this moment of stepping forward—chosen to be part of a mission that will shape the fate of Falsia.

-- Character Questions and interaction can happen in this time, shortly before the next scene --

As the sun begins to set, casting a golden hue over the city of Falsia, the chosen spies find themselves in a dimly lit room within a nearby tavern, their temporary haven before the masquerade at the mansion. A flickering candle casts dancing shadows across the walls, revealing a small collection of clothing laid out on a rough wooden table.

"All right, everyone," says one of you, a mixture of excitement and nerves in your voice. “Tonight, we blend in. We need to look the part.”

The garments before you range from elegant dresses and tailored suits to cloaks adorned with subtle embellishments that speak of wealth and status. Each piece is designed to ensure you move seamlessly among the upper crust of Falsian society.

The sun begins to set on the harbor, as the PCs begin to dress for the occasion, and talk amongst themselves. 

## The Mystery of Thorne Manor

Victim: Valerian Thorne


Valerian Thorn was born into a family of modest means but quickly rose through the ranks of Falsia's political system due to his sharp intellect and undeniable charm. Throughout his rise, his closest childhood friend, Aric Hale, followed a similar path. The two had once shared dreams of leading Falsia into a new era of prosperity, but as they grew older, their political ideologies began to diverge.

While Valerian was idealistic in his younger years, Aric became more pragmatic and ruthless, using any means necessary to secure power. Though still maintaining a public friendship, their relationship became fraught with competition. Political factions grew around them, and the rivalry that had once been friendly turned dark.

**

Under increasing political pressure from Aric, Valerian felt the weight of his rival’s growing influence. Aric, now a powerful and cunning politician, had been leveraging alliances and making shadowy deals with various factions to secure his dominance. Fearing that he would lose everything to his childhood rival, Valerian made a desperate choice: he joined a secret cult that promised him the resources and influence needed to surpass Aric.

But this decision haunted Valerian. As his involvement deepened, he discovered the cult’s dark side—human experiments, forbidden magic, and the sacrifice of innocent lives. Worse still, he realized Aric might have known about the cult all along and had subtly nudged him into joining, hoping to corrupt or destroy Valerian's reputation.

**

One fateful night, Valerian stumbled upon one of the cult’s horrific rituals. Children were being sacrificed, and twisted magic flowed freely. His conscience couldn’t bear the weight of what he had become complicit in. Valerian’s guilt and fear pushed him to a breaking point. He resolved to expose the cult’s evil deeds, but he knew that doing so would also mean revealing his own involvement, likely leading to his downfall.

This party would be his moment of redemption, a final stand to reveal the truth about the cult—and perhaps, implicate Aric as well, though he could not prove his rival’s connection just yet.

**

## Suspects


### 1. Aric Hale

- Role: Rival and childhood friend of Valerian Thorn.
    
- Motive: Aric is deeply concerned for Valerian’s safety but also stands to gain politically if Valerian is out of the picture. His inner conflict between friendship and rivalry makes him a complex character.
    
- Involvement: Innocent of the murder, Aric might still be hiding vital information to protect his own reputation.
    

### 2. Marion Callis

- Role: Head of security at the mansion.
    
- Motive: Paid off by the cult to overlook their activities, Marion fears losing her position if Valerian reveals their dealings.

### 4. Eramis Frostclaw

- Role: Aristocrat with deep ties to Falsia’s high society.
    
- Motive: Eramis has secret business ties to the cult, and Valerian’s exposure would jeopardize his interests and status.
    
- Involvement: Although he didn't murder Valerian directly, he could be complicit in covering up the cult's actions.
    

### 5. The High Council Member (Secret PC)

- Role: A member of the cult's high council.
    
- Motive: Tasked with ensuring that the cult's activities remain hidden and that their identity is protected, they may feel torn between loyalty to the cult and the PCs.

### 6. Cecilia Wren

- Role: A renowned gossip columnist known for her connections within the upper echelons of Falsian society.
    
- Motive: Cecilia thrives on scandal and would benefit from a sensational story. If Valerian’s expose leads to a political uproar, it would give her column a major boost and ensure her relevance in society.
    
- Involvement: While not directly involved in the murder, Cecilia could have been privy to information that implicates various parties. She may have inadvertently spread rumors that heightened tensions among the suspects.
    

### 7. Gaius Blackthorn

- Role: An influential merchant with deep ties to both the government and the underbelly of Falsian society.
    
- Motive: Gaius has financial dealings that would be adversely affected by Valerian’s revelations about the cult. He seeks to maintain his wealth and influence, and eliminating Valerian would serve as a means to that end.
    
- Involvement: Gaius could be seen as a key player in the events leading up to the murder, possibly even having the means to arrange it without getting his hands dirty directly.
    

## Killer/s, Accomplice/s

### Eramis Frostclaw - Killer

**Role:** Crime boss posing as Falsia's arms dealer.  
**Background:** Eramis is a well-known figure in Falsia's high society, reputed for his lavish parties and influential connections. Underneath this polished exterior lies a cunning criminal mastermind who controls the underbelly of the city. He supplies the government with weapons and gear, maintaining a façade of loyalty to the state while secretly aligning himself with the cult to further his interests.

**Motive:** Eramis fears that Valerian’s planned exposure of the cult will not only jeopardize his illicit dealings but also his position of power. If Valerian succeeds in revealing the cult's activities, it could lead to increased scrutiny of his own operations, risking everything he has built.

**Involvement:** While he may not have directly committed the murder, Eramis is heavily involved in orchestrating the events leading up to it. He could have facilitated the murder through hired muscle or provided resources for the killer. Additionally, his close ties with the cult provide him with insider information, allowing him to manipulate events from the shadows to serve his agenda.

Eramis Frostclaw, the crime boss posing as Falsia’s arms dealer, kills Valerian Thorne at the party in the mansion. He arranges for the murder to look like a subtle assassination, likely using poison. Given his connection to the cult and desire to protect his business interests, he ensures the poison mimics something less suspicious, like a heart attack or a slow-acting venom, making it difficult to trace.

Thorne, being on the verge of exposing the cult, had grown paranoid, and Eramis, knowing Thorne’s every move, took the opportunity at the party to quietly administer the poison in a drink or food, under the guise of casual conversation. As Thorne begins to falter and grow weak, Eramis ensures his presence remains unnoticed, blending in with the other guests as the chaos unfolds.

Eramis would likely have a trusted accomplice (perhaps a servant or one of the other suspects like Marion Callis) who helps cover up the tracks, ensuring no clear evidence leads back to him.

### Marion Callis - Accomplice

### Role: Head of Security, Accomplice

**Background:** Marion Callis is a seasoned security professional, having spent years protecting high-profile events and figures in Falsia. She takes pride in her work and has built a reputation for being vigilant and reliable. Marion grew up in a lower-class neighborhood and worked her way up the ranks through sheer determination and skill. She understands the stakes of the elite world she now inhabits but remains haunted by her humble beginnings.

**Appearance:** Marion has a commanding presence, standing tall with a strong build. Her dark hair is typically pulled back in a no-nonsense bun, allowing her sharp, observant eyes to scan her surroundings without distraction. She wears practical yet elegant attire that blends well with the mansion’s atmosphere while allowing for ease of movement.

**Motive:** Marion's primary motive stems from her ties to the cult. She has been paid off to overlook certain activities within the mansion, fearing that Valerian’s revelation about the cult will lead to her losing her position and, ultimately, her stability. The pressure of keeping her job weighs heavily on her, creating a conflict between her duty to the guests and her desire for self-preservation.

**Involvement:** Although she didn’t murder Valerian Thorn, Marion’s negligence in her duties may have contributed to the circumstances that allowed the murder to occur. She may have compromised security measures to avoid suspicion or to maintain her connection with the cult. This could create a compelling dynamic where she is not a direct killer but is nonetheless implicated in the chaos.

**Personality:** Marion is a pragmatic and tough individual, often coming off as cold or aloof to others. However, beneath her hard exterior lies a sense of loyalty to those she cares about, as well as a deep-seated fear of failure. She struggles with the moral implications of her actions, caught between her desire for success and the knowledge that she may be protecting something sinister.

**Potential Development:** Throughout the campaign, Marion could serve as a source of tension. Players might initially see her as an ally, only to later uncover her questionable decisions and motivations. Depending on the players' actions and choices, Marion could either become a reluctant ally seeking redemption or a direct antagonist trying to protect her interests.

### Saphira Drenn

### **Role**: Valerian Thorn’s personal assistant/Innocent

Background:

Saphira Drenn comes from a modest background but managed to work her way into Valerian Thorn’s inner circle as his personal assistant. She’s resourceful, sharp, and loyal to Valerian—at least, that’s how things used to be. She began working for Valerian several years ago when he first became mayor of Falsia’s Commonwealth, and quickly became indispensable due to her organizational skills and ability to keep secrets.

For a long time, Saphira admired Valerian’s ambition and dedication to making Falsia prosperous, unaware of his shady dealings with the cult. However, once she uncovered his connections to the secret cult and his participation in their dark experiments, her view of him shattered. Yet, she remained by his side out of fear and a lack of options—if Valerian went down, so would she.

#### **Motivation**:

Saphira’s main motivation is self-preservation. She knows that if Valerian exposes the cult and its illegal activities, her involvement, even indirectly, could ruin her life. She holds key information about Valerian's inner dealings, both political and personal. Although not directly involved with the cult, she has witnessed disturbing evidence of their influence and Valerian's interactions with them. She harbors a deep resentment toward him for dragging her into such dangerous affairs without her consent.

Her fear isn’t just about political consequences but also about the possibility of retaliation from the cult if she’s implicated. Saphira is caught between protecting herself and the man she once trusted, and navigating the treacherous waters of Falsian politics.

#### **Motive**:

- **Fear of Exposure**: Saphira is terrified that Valerian’s plan to reveal the cult's dark secrets will bring her down with him. She may not be guilty of any major crimes, but her complicity in covering up small details and turning a blind eye to the cult’s activities makes her vulnerable.
- **Betrayal**: Saphira feels deeply betrayed by Valerian. He kept her in the dark for years, and when she finally learned the truth, she felt trapped in a web of lies. While she cares about her career and life in Falsia, she is also driven by an emotional need for justice—or revenge—for being manipulated by him.

#### **Involvement**:

Saphira is **innocent** of the actual murder, but she is deeply involved in the circumstances surrounding Valerian’s death:

- She knew about his connections to the cult and his plan to expose them at the party. In fact, she was helping him prepare his materials and gathering evidence.
- She might have provided crucial information to **Marion Callis** or **Eramis Frostclaw** unknowingly, thinking she was simply performing her duties.
- After the murder, she may withhold key details out of fear or confusion, not knowing who to trust. Her information about Valerian’s dealings could prove vital for the PCs if they can earn her trust or pressure her into revealing what she knows.

#### **Relationships**:

1. **Valerian Thorn**: Saphira was once fiercely loyal to Valerian but feels profoundly betrayed by his manipulation and secrets. While she doesn't hate him, her feelings are complicated—there’s a mix of resentment, admiration, and a sense of duty.
2. **Eramis Frostclaw**: Saphira knows of Eramis’s connection to Valerian and the cult but is careful not to get too close. She avoids him when possible, fearing his reputation as a dangerous and influential man. She may suspect he had a role in Valerian’s death.
3. **Marion Callis**: Saphira sees Marion as an ally within the mansion’s hierarchy but suspects that Marion knows more about the murder than she lets on. She might try to question or align with Marion in a bid to protect herself.
4. **The Cult**: Though Saphira is not a member of the cult, she has seen glimpses of their activities through her association with Valerian. The thought of the cult discovering her knowledge haunts her, and she fears they will target her if she doesn't tread carefully.

#### **Role in the Mystery**:

- **Key Witness**: Saphira holds critical information about Valerian's plans and connections to the cult. She can provide clues that lead the PCs toward the truth, but she’s reluctant to reveal everything, fearing for her safety.
- **Red Herring**: Due to her close proximity to Valerian and her knowledge of his dealings, she could easily be seen as a prime suspect. Her nervous behavior and reluctance to share details could mislead the players into suspecting her.
- **Emotional Complexity**: Saphira is torn between a desire for justice and a fear of being implicated. This internal struggle could create dramatic tension, especially if the players interrogate her or try to pressure her into revealing what she knows.

#### **Possible Evidence Linking Saphira**:

- **Personal Letters**: Correspondence between her and Valerian about the upcoming party and his planned revelation, hinting at her awareness of the dangers surrounding the event.
- **Bloodied Handkerchief**: Saphira was near the crime scene shortly after Valerian's death. A bloodied handkerchief found in her possession might raise suspicions, though it could be explained by her discovering his body.
- **Burnt Notes**: Saphira might have burned some of Valerian’s incriminating documents in a panic after his murder, leaving behind fragments that the PCs can find and piece together.

#### **Future Role in the Campaign**:

Saphira can evolve as the mystery unfolds. If the PCs help her, she could become a valuable ally in uncovering the deeper cult conspiracy, especially if the PCs work to clear her name. Alternatively, if they push her too hard, she might withhold vital information, leading to dead ends in their investigation. If they uncover too much about the cult, she may grow paranoid, leading to erratic or defensive behavior.

Saphira Drenn represents someone trapped in the moral gray area of Falsia’s political landscape, a victim of circumstance, and a key piece of the puzzle to unraveling the murder of Valerian Thorn.

### Cecilia Wren

#### **Role**: Renowned gossip columnist

#### **Background**:

Cecilia Wren is a fixture in the upper echelons of Falsian society. As a gossip columnist, she has built a career on uncovering scandal, rumors, and the secrets of the elite. She possesses a vast network of informants, from servants in noble households to disgruntled politicians, all feeding her a constant stream of information. Her column, “Whispers of Falsia,” is widely read, feared, and respected. Many people in Falsia’s high society find themselves playing nice with her, hoping to avoid becoming the next subject of her scathing articles.

Cecilia grew up in a lower-class household but clawed her way up to fame through cunning, manipulation, and a sharp intellect. Her charm allows her to navigate social circles and win people’s trust, though behind her pleasant smile lies a ruthless opportunist. Her love of gossip is both her passion and her power, giving her control over the social narrative of the city.

#### **Motivation**:

- **Ambition**: Cecilia is always hungry for the next big story. Valerian’s murder offers her a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to write about something that could shake the foundations of Falsia. Exposing a murder, a cult, and political corruption would cement her status as the most powerful voice in Falsian media.
- **Leverage**: Cecilia thrives on the power that comes with knowledge. If she uncovers key information about the murder or the cult, she will hold it over others to advance her own interests. Whether that’s blackmail, publishing an article, or trading secrets for favors, she’ll find a way to make the most out of what she knows.
- **Survival**: Despite her cutthroat nature, Cecilia understands the dangers of delving too deeply into the wrong secrets. Valerian’s murder ties back to the cult, and as she digs deeper, she might realize how far-reaching and dangerous their influence is. If she uncovers too much, Cecilia might fear for her own safety, making her even more cautious about whom she trusts and what she reveals.

#### **Involvement**:

- **Witness to Secrets**: Cecilia wasn’t directly involved in Valerian’s murder, but she knows more than she lets on. Her sources have already whispered rumors about Valerian’s secret dealings and connections to unsavory characters like Eramis Frostclaw. She’s had her eye on Valerian for months, suspecting that something big was going on behind the scenes.
- **Unwitting Manipulation**: It’s possible that some of the rumors Cecilia published about Valerian helped push the events leading to his murder. She could have unintentionally spread misinformation or heightened tensions between Valerian and the other suspects. The cult may even have used her to plant false information to keep people guessing.

#### **Motive**:

- **Gain from Scandal**: Valerian’s exposure would bring her immense popularity. Writing the story of a high-ranking official’s fall from grace, tied to a murder mystery and secret cult, would be the biggest scoop of her career. She stands to gain in fame, wealth, and influence if she uncovers the truth before anyone else.
- **Deflection**: If Cecilia gets too close to the truth, she might realize how dangerous the cult really is. Rather than expose the full story, she could seek to control the narrative, revealing only what benefits her while keeping more sensitive details hidden to protect herself.

#### **Relationships**:

1. **Valerian Thorn**: Cecilia was always suspicious of Valerian and saw him as a potential source of a major story. She was aware of his political maneuvering and likely knew of his connections to the cult, though she hadn’t uncovered the full scope of his involvement. She viewed Valerian as both a target and a potential source of leverage.
2. **Eramis Frostclaw**: Eramis and Cecilia share a complicated relationship. As a crime boss posing as a respectable arms dealer, Eramis has provided Cecilia with occasional tips and gossip in exchange for her keeping his criminal dealings out of her columns. Cecilia respects his power but is always looking for an opportunity to exploit his secrets.
3. **Marion Callis**: Marion dislikes Cecilia’s presence at the mansion, seeing her as a potential threat to security and stability. Cecilia, on the other hand, finds Marion’s stern, secretive demeanor fascinating and would love to uncover what Marion is hiding.
4. **Saphira Drenn**: Cecilia views Saphira as a potential pawn. She knows Saphira is close to Valerian and might hold valuable information about him. Cecilia would use charm or manipulation to get Saphira to open up, knowing that Saphira’s loyalty is wavering.
5. **Aric Hale**: Cecilia has covered Aric’s rivalry with Valerian extensively, seeing it as a juicy political drama. She might know more about Aric’s relationship with Valerian than she’s willing to let on, and she could use this to pressure Aric into giving her more details if necessary.

#### **Role in the Mystery**:

- **Informant or Manipulator**: Cecilia can serve as a valuable informant for the PCs if they earn her trust or convince her that helping them will further her career. However, she’s also prone to manipulating them, feeding them only selective information to steer the investigation in directions that benefit her.
- **Red Herring**: Her tendency to stir up drama and seek scandal could make her a prime suspect in the murder. Her opportunistic nature might lead players to believe she played a more direct role in Valerian’s downfall than she actually did.
- **Keeper of Secrets**: Cecilia likely knows more about the cult than she reveals early on. She could provide the PCs with important leads—rumors she’s heard or details about Valerian’s political rivals—but only if she deems it worth the risk. If the PCs push her too hard or appear to be getting too close to the truth, she might withhold crucial information to protect herself.

#### **Possible Evidence**:

- **Unpublished Notes**: Cecilia’s personal notes on Valerian could provide valuable insights into his dealings with the cult. Her notes may mention names, locations, or meetings that lead the PCs closer to the truth.
- **Letters from Informants**: Cecilia receives letters from various sources, and one of these might contain cryptic hints about Valerian’s murder or the cult’s activities. A partially burned or incomplete letter could serve as a clue.
- **A Secret Recording**: Perhaps Cecilia overheard a conversation between two of the suspects and secretly recorded it, intending to use it later for an exposé. The recording might contain incriminating evidence, though the full context may be unclear.

#### **Future Role in the Campaign**:

Cecilia can serve as a recurring character, always looking for the next big scoop and willing to trade favors for information. She’s never fully trustworthy, but her knowledge of Falsian society and her extensive network make her a valuable asset. If the PCs play their cards right, she could become an ally—albeit one with her own agenda—or a dangerous adversary if they cross her.

As the campaign progresses, Cecilia might uncover deeper layers of the cult's influence and struggle with whether to reveal everything or protect her own skin. She could even get caught up in the cult’s machinations, becoming a target herself or inadvertently helping the PCs by publishing a story that draws more attention to their investigation.

Cecilia Wren is a character who thrives on the power of information. She’s a master manipulator, always working behind the scenes, making her a dangerous but potentially helpful figure in the unfolding mystery.

### Pre-Murder Timeline of Events

#### 1. **Arrival at the Mansion (Late Afternoon)**

- The party begins, hosted at a luxurious mansion in the high cities of Falsia. The mansion is surrounded by dense forest and brush, adding a sense of isolation.
- **Guests arrive in lavish carriages**, and guards direct them inside. There is a mix of political figures, aristocrats, and select individuals with mysterious agendas (including the suspects).
- **Valerian Thorn** is present, though he seems uneasy, clearly distracted and apprehensive about something. He keeps a distance from the crowd, having brief private conversations with certain individuals, especially Aric Hale, who is visibly concerned for his friend.
- **The PCs are introduced** as part of the "special jury" invited to observe and potentially stop a rumored assassination. They are meant to blend into the event, gathering information without drawing attention to their purpose.

#### 2. **The Political Tension (Early Evening)**

- **Eramis Frostclaw** is making rounds, mingling with high-ranking officials, discussing trade agreements, and subtly pushing his arms deals. He mentions Falsia’s upcoming needs for more weapons, hinting at underlying conflicts.
- **Saphira Drenn**, Valerian’s assistant, is nervously pacing and trying to stay out of sight, feeling the weight of the secrets she knows.
- **Marion Callis** is supervising the security measures, but it becomes apparent that there are gaps in her coverage. The players may notice that some areas of the mansion, particularly near Valerian’s quarters, are suspiciously unguarded.
- **Cecilia Wren**, the gossip columnist, is eavesdropping on conversations, scribbling notes in her journal. She seems especially interested in Valerian and Eramis.

#### 3. **The Private Conversations (Nightfall)**

- **Valerian meets Aric Hale** in one of the mansion's private drawing rooms. The two share an emotional conversation where Aric, torn between rivalry and friendship, urges Valerian not to go through with whatever he's planning.
    - Valerian insists on revealing the cult's secrets, saying it's the only way to cleanse his conscience, but Aric pleads with him to reconsider for his own safety.
- **Valerian then meets with Saphira Drenn**, telling her to prepare some documents related to the cult. Saphira, anxious and feeling betrayed, begs him to reconsider, knowing that any exposure of the cult would destroy her future.
- Meanwhile, **Marion Callis has a covert meeting with Eramis Frostclaw** in a secluded part of the mansion. Eramis gives her one last payment, ensuring that the security tonight will be "lax."

#### 4. **The First Signs of Trouble (Late Night)**

- **A loud argument erupts** between Valerian and Eramis during a toast to Falsia's future. Valerian cryptically mentions dark secrets that will soon come to light, leaving Eramis visibly shaken.
- As the argument escalates, **the lights flicker**, adding an eerie atmosphere to the gathering.
- **Cecilia Wren**, always looking for a scoop, slips into a restricted area and overhears snippets of a conversation between Marion and another unnamed figure. They speak of "making sure nothing disrupts the plan," but she’s caught and escorted back to the main hall before she can learn more.

#### 5. **The Last Warning (Shortly Before the Murder)**

- **The players are pulled aside** by a messenger claiming to have overheard someone discussing a potential assassination attempt. They are tasked with keeping a close eye on Valerian and anyone who interacts with him.
- **Valerian slips away** from the party, heading toward his private chambers to prepare for his speech, where he intends to reveal the cult’s secrets.
- **Saphira Drenn** attempts to stop him one last time but fails. She walks away, visibly distraught.
- **Marion Callis and her guards** allow certain areas to go unpatrolled. The players may sense something is off but won’t yet have clear evidence of Marion’s role in it.

#### 6. **The Murder (Moments Later)**

- **Valerian Thorn is found dead** in his private office, stabbed with a ceremonial dagger. The PCs are the first on the scene, either arriving because they were already investigating or because of a loud noise that draws them to the location.
- The players notice certain clues that will mislead them toward multiple suspects (e.g., signs of tampered security, a note from Valerian, items linking Eramis or Saphira, etc.).


### **Location of the Murder: The Mansion’s Conservatory**

- **Setting**: The conservatory is a glass-enclosed room filled with exotic plants, flowers, and even some rare fruits. It has a serene atmosphere, with sunlight streaming through the glass, creating a bright, inviting environment. However, the beauty of the room belies the dark events that unfold within its walls.
    
- **Seclusion**: The conservatory is somewhat removed from the main gathering areas of the mansion, providing an opportunity for a private conversation—or a covert meeting—away from the watchful eyes of guests. Its location makes it an ideal spot for a clandestine encounter, where Valerian could meet someone without being interrupted.
    
- **Ambiance**: The sounds of rustling leaves and the sweet fragrance of flowers create a deceptive sense of calm. However, once the murder occurs, this beautiful setting transforms into a chilling scene of betrayal and chaos, heightening the emotional stakes for the characters.
    
- **Evidence**: The scene may hold important clues, such as:
    
    - **Blood Stains**: Evidence of the struggle could be present, perhaps on the glass panels or the surrounding plants.
    - **Dropped Items**: A personal belonging of Valerian’s, such as a cufflink or a piece of jewelry, may have been left behind during the struggle.
    - **Signs of a Struggle**: Disheveled plants or broken glass could indicate that a violent confrontation took place here.
- **Access**: Only select individuals would have known about this location being used for meetings, making it a focal point of suspicion. This adds layers to the investigation, as players may question who had access to the conservatory and why they might want to meet Valerian there.
    

The choice of the conservatory as the murder location serves as a powerful backdrop to the unfolding mystery, contrasting beauty with violence and intrigue.
