# Hungar the IV
> 
Hungar the IV had grew up in the outskirts of the Falsian republic, the village of Triticus to be specific. It was a village of well known poverty, being one of the poorest villages in the Falsian Republic. This village was assigned the task of providing fresh cattle and agriculture to the lands of Falsia, and you were raised by your mother and father, Hungar the III, and Helsia. With them, you were raised with an older brother, Tuah the Brave. You know him as protective, righteous, and your idol in life to be altruistic, kind hearted, and strong. When Hungar was 11 years old, Tuah had enlisted in the army of Falsia, in which Hungar wanted to enlist as well. Tuah was hesistant at first, but knew that Hungar was a bright soul, beaming with potential. Hungar wanted to join to provide the money for his family to survive, for he was aware of the troubling times they had been going through. His mother had fell ill, and needed the proper funds for her to afford proper medical care. Both Hungar and Tuah set along their joined path, into the Falsian Military. A league of knights trained under the might of Falsia, hand crafted with the intention of perfection. Once hungar saw them, he knew what he wanted to become. A proud warrior of Falsia, the symbol as the Warrior Jorr was in ancient history. His family name would be knowed across the lands, and the kid who was never seen, will finally be within the light. Hungar was thrust into the pre-basic training regime, whereas Tuah was placed in the knight division immediatly once passing his test with excellent skills. Before leaving, Tuah handed his brother a necklace of Magnorta stone, gleaming when reflecting Helslight. "You are brave. The most in the lands. Your name is your own, not what people tell you. 1/2

Hold it close to your heart, and pray to Hel. To Jorr." and he left, to the knights division, where you will be seperated from him for some time. Fast forward 5 years in time, you have finally been enlisted in the knights division, your dream since the beginning. On top of this, you have finally been placed in the same squadrant as your brother, Tuah, who had been promoted to assistant General of the Hawk division. Once you see him, you both embraced in a brotherly hug. However, why you were enlisted in the Hawk division is one of desperation, and ill spent time. For this is before the battle of the rotten muds. A monumental battle in Jorr's history, the battle with the most casualties in Jorr's entire history. This battle changed you, however, it is what happened during this battle that changed you the most. You're fighting alongside your brother, as your brothers fall alongside you in battle left and right, against the Bjorn empire. This battle was ruthless, lasting 3 days and nights. on the final night, however, you see something you were not supposed to see. You see soldiers from the Bear division, drag your brother into a trench, and kill him in cold blood. Enraged, you charge at them, but all of sudden, an ambush of Bjorn soldiers ensues, killing the soldiers who had killed your brother, and capturing you and holding you as prisoner, where you would spent a 5 years of your life tortured and enslaved by the Bjorn empire. One night, you manage to escape your capture, and run for days on end. You see a boat sailing for Falsia, and you take it right away. You want revenge on whoever ordered the hit on your brother in the Falsian military ranks, and the people of Bjorn who had enslaved you for years on end. You will make your name known, across the lands of Jorr, in your own way, with your brother always beside your heart, around your neck.

# Personality
###### Personality Traits
- Vengeful, representing the house of Hawk and the people of my town. I cultivate a single obscure hobby or study and eagerly discuss it at length

###### Ideals
- Place in society shouldn't determine one's access to what is right. Deception is a weapon. Strike from where your foes won't expect.

###### Bonds
- I do everything for my family. My first thought is keeping them safe. I've seen too many in need. I must not fail them as everyone else has. I do everything for those who were taken from me.

###### Flaws
- I have no sense of humor. Laughing is uncomfortable and embarrassing.
