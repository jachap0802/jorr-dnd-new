# Aurelian Urizen
> Aurelian Urizen's origins are from the nation of D'rakel, a nation long lost to the world, but still very much alive. Urizen was created with the magic of the Dr'akel monks, following the will of Jorr. His existence had always been looked down upon, by his peers he had grown up with, and his friends. His faith in the religion of Jorr in which the monks had followed had always been meaningful to him, and he holds it close within his heart. However, he feels as if he does not belong. Not only amongst his peers in the nation of D'rakel, but to this plane in which he roams. He was raised and sheltered by the monastary of the D'rakel monks, and held under precious care and raised under the will of Jorr. However, he has an urge within him to go where he belongs, to the realm in which he belongs. His home. The monks of D'rakel support his venture for self discovery, because they too do not know the true source of his existence. He knows he is meant for something more, so he goes on a journey of self discovery, to discover who he truly is.
