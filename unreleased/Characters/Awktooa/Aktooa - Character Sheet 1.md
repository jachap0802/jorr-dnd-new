# Aktooa

> Awktooa is from the nation of Dr'akel, a nation hidden from the rest of the land of Jorr, due to the ancient magic of the shaping sands, the nations secrets and history are kept from the rest of the world. A natinon covered in dunes and sand, the only nation holding the myserious, "Shaping Sands". You are born from this nation, from your father named Featheran, and your mother named Silvara. You always remember them as kind people, giving to the community and the rest of the monastery, and meeting with friends of your neighborhood alike. Your parents were high ranking officials in the temple of Dr'akel, almost considered as royalty within the nation, but not really due to its governing system, which was one of equals amongst the nation. The Dr'akel monks followed the religion of Jorr, one where Jorr was the creator of this planet, using the power of the shaping sands to shape reality to his liking. To them, everyone is of the sands. Everyone is one, all existing as a part of Jorr, connected. And Dr'akel is the blessed lands of the entirety of Jorr, sacred, and to remain hidden for all of time. One night, as you are coming home from a night with friends, you hear rustling within your parents bedroom, and choose to investigate, to discover your parents have been slaughtered by a single member of the monastary. Enraged, you tackle him to the ground, asking why he would do such a thing. You beat him to a pulp, his dying breath being one phrase "..Radi..ax." Once saying this, he disapears, in a poof of glowing red energy, pushing you back. You go around the nation, asking questions of Radiax, and who or what this name means. As you are asking questions, you are captured by the monastery, in a secret meeting. They tell you that the cause of your parent's death must remain hidden, and no one can hear about this Radiax. Enraged, you banish yourself from the monastery, left in shambles as your own temple has betrayed you. and as you are leaving the Dr'akel nation, you are captured by a group of hooded figures, only able to see the glowing red from their eyes. You wake up in a mysterious room that seems to be underground, covered in runes glowing bright red. They tell you that the members of the Dr'akel monastery are insidious traders, using mysterious magic to create a living being using the shaping sands, by the name of Aurelian Urizen. They tell you this being holds the key to the monastery, and taking down the corrupt members of the monastery. They just need you to take their hand. In pure desperation and rage, you take it, only to be thrust into visions of an ancient history. A boy enslaved by a tribe of vikings, stone giants and dragons of old, but the most of all, The visions of Titans. Outside the wall of reality, under the rule of one. Radiax. You are taken aback, the members of this group all chant, "ALL HAIL THE EYE OF RADIAX". You have been cursed under the might of Radiax, and have become a member of the mortal hand of Radiax, a council of 5, spread across the nations of Jorr. Your goal is to find Aurelian Urizen, collect the 3 artifacts of Jorr, and release yourself from the clutches of Radiax. You still maintain your free will, but only answer to the titan of Radiax, in which you have direct contact with. You roam the underground of Jorr, stealing and plotting to survive, until the voice of Radiax tells you to follow this lead, as this is the way to finding the one you desire, and to cleanup the mess of the cult that enacted the murder of this child. You venture off on a boat to Falsia, hoping to find the three artifacts of Jorr, find Aurelian Urizen, and free yourself from the torment that has been cursed upon you.
