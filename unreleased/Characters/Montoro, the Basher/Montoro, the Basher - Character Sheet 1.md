# Montoro, The Basher

Montoro is a battle-hardened bearfolk, in an unnamed village deep within the Rotten Muds of the Bjorn Empire, aligned with the faction of Balder, the old. He prides himself in his people, but is proud of his nation, as the bearfolk are a very prominent subculture of the Bjorn empire, making up a good 30% of their entire population. He volunteers in raids and battles along the Falsian border, and hates the Falsian Republic with a passion, as they have laid seige to the lands of Bjorn in the past. One night, a group of Falsian soldiers had laid siege to your village, destroying a majority of your village, and your family. The new regime of Orn ignored the destruction of your village, so in your own sense of vengeance, you stratle along your own path, following a lead that Falsia holds an artifact of unknown power, that can hold the key to enact your vengeance. You carry the skull of your mother along your head, her soul connected to yours, always by your side.
