# Personality
###### Personality Traits
- Vengeful, representing the house of Hawk and the people of my town. I cultivate a single obscure hobby or study and eagerly discuss it at length

###### Ideals
- Place in society shouldn't determine one's access to what is right. Deception is a weapon. Strike from where your foes won't expect.

###### Bonds
- I do everything for my family. My first thought is keeping them safe. I've seen too many in need. I must not fail them as everyone else has. I do everything for those who were taken from me.

###### Flaws
- I have no sense of humor. Laughing is uncomfortable and embarrassing.
