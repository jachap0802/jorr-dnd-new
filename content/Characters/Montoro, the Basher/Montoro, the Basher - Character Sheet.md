As a grizzlehide bearfolk, you are thicker and hardier than your cousins. Grizzlehide fur ranges from black to golden, often with light gray or blonde tips. Tough and ferocious grizzlehides are the original bearfolk stock native to the colder northern climes. 

Thick Coat. You are resistant to cold damage. 

Bear Hug. When you take the Attack action, you can make an unarmed strike as a bonus action. If you hit, you can grapple the target in addition to dealing damage to it.
