Our first session takes place on the harbor of Braun, with our protagonists, as well as citizens from across the lands of Jorr, all coming onto the harbor from a longship, arriving from a long trip to the Republic of Falsia. Once arriving, the head of the Lion Regime of the Falsian military, Citratus, announces that these citizens have been called here for a special duty, in which will be rewarded handsomely. The citizens line up, including our playable characters, and are each given a number, our playable characters all having the number "3", getting their papers from dark figures in the shacks. Citratus then announced the means of the gathering of citizens, to investigate a possible hit on a high government official of Falsia, Valerian Thorne, the mayor of the commonwealth of Falsia. Whoever's number is chosen, will be put in a special group of 7, for the purpose of being spies in an upcoming party celebrating the mayor-elect. 

Once announcing the means of the gathering, Citratus then announces the players, announcing that everyone with the number "3" will be put in the special squad as spies. This 7 people are all of our players, and they are then guided to Garrick's Shed of Trinkets and Mysteries.

Here, they all choose special outfits/costumes to match the occasion of a fancy party. Here is what everyone chooses:

Hungar : Gnome costume, with a red hat along with a monk-like necklace.

Awktooa : An all black suit, with a black tie and black cufflinks

Tenet: A red gnome hat, similar to Hungar's costume but smaller, gave the shopkeeper a coin of unknown origin.

Molasses: A mysterious stone ring, with runes along its diameter, with Bjorn's national symbol

Aurelian: A Black suit with a green tie, along with an amulet of mysterious origin, glowing red in certain situations.

Mierda: A bracelet held together by loose string, balls with special runes along each ball.

Gaia: A blue shiny dress, shining against the light

Once they are done dressing up, Hungar goes to see what is taking the guards so long to be taken to the mansion, and sees Garrick talking with two Falsian guards, who give Hungar an interesting look, but continue their work. After this moment, Citratus comes with a carriage, making their way to the mansion.

## The Mystery of Thorne Manor

Our players arrive at the manor, initially introduced by the Manor owner, Valerian Thorne. He greets the guests, feeling very anxious and paranoid, always looking around them, but still keeping a calm demeanor. He leads all of you to the entrance of the manor, introduced by two guards of the manor. They initially cross their arms, but once seeing the guests, open up. They initially confront Molasses, saying his lantern is not allowed within the manor, however, the other characters convince the guards to let him keep it. They agree, and continue forward, until stopped by Marion Callis, the head of security of the Thorne Manor. They are all asked to sign in, however, both Tenet and Aurelian notice a mysterious smudge within the logs of the sign in sheet, listed as the first name on the list, if not erased. Keeping it in mind, our characters continue to the party room of the mansion. Molasses looks at a nearby bookshelf, picking out some books, major ones being, "The Bjorn Empire and it's history", and a book of unknown age and origin, covered in cobwebs. Both Molasses and Tenet keep this in mind, and continue to the party room.

There, they are introduced to the entire party cast. Aric Hale, Saphira Drenn, Cecilia Wren, and Gaius Blackthorn. The players are introduced, and are having a good time, especially Awktooa in Aric Hale's company, as they both chose to drink quite a lot, getting quite drunk in the meantime. Aric starts to grab from a mysterious hole under the floorboards of the room, grabbing what seems to be a large quantity of alcohol. Awktooa drinks with Aric, the both of them becoming quite drunk, with Awktooa falling to the ground. Molasses reads his found books in the corner, Tenet sitting back in a table investigating what is around him. In the distance however, Aurelian chooses to keep a close eye on Aric. Using investigation, he sees a dagger of sorts tied to Aric's waste, with a distinct family crest. He keeps this in mind, and lets Tenet know of this discovery in secret. We move to Hungar, where he begins to question Eramis and who he is. All he mentions is that he is in the trades business. As Tenet is talking with Molasses about the book concerning Bjorn's history, Cecilia comes up to him, wondering what he is doing, as she has not seen or studied the presence of magic. He dismisses these questions and asks what her business is here. Cecilia tells him, and only him, that she is a reporter from the Bjorn empire, looking for a juicy story and information on the Falsian empire. Tenet keeps this in mind. It is during this time, Valerian makes his way back in to the party room, once again saying hi to all his guests. Valerian and Aric embrace in a hug, and Aric asks to talk to Valerian in secret. Hungar chooses to follow, Saphira Drenn, and Eramis all finding the opportunity to leave the room. At this time, the following discoveries are found:

A mysterious conversation between Aric and Valerian.

A mysterious conversation between Valerian and a female voice.

A black box found in a room within the party room, with 2 locks.

Once these pieces of evidence are found, some of our pcs, and all the party guests making their way to the feast room, with the exception of Awktooa, Tenet, Aurelian, and Molasses. When alone, Tenet decides to search the Aric Hale alcohol hole again, discovering:

Two mysterious bottles of alcohol, with a hole in it, but still maintaining liquid. Clearly magical properties.

Switch back to the feast room, Valerian thanks his guests for being there, with Saphira Drenn passing out drinks to the entire room, all sharing a toast. they drink, and share a moment to eat. A couple minutes go by, and Valerian seems to feel ill. He leaves the room, catching the attention of the people still in the party room. Awktooa and Tenet choose to follow Valerian up to the second floor, with Aurelian and Molasses staying on the first to make sure the two don't get caught, hearing Cecilia exiting the food room as well.
\
The two successfully make their way to the second floor, with Tenet making some noise. They hear a slam on one of the doors on the second floor, but not the specific door in which it came from. They search, Awktooa going down the hall to the left, hearing some distant steps from a nearby room, seemly in a rush. Tenet staying on the staircase, hearing more people getting out of the feast room to see what is going on. He sends a message to Meirda, giving her information in an argument with Cecilia, pressuring her into giving her more information about her true reason she is here. She stands firm that she is from Falsia. People begin to question this. Before the questioning commences however, it is interrupted by a large scream, and then a thud hitting the floor. Everyone hears this, and starts making their way upstairs. Awktooa and Tenet discover the body in a closet room, and hear the guests coming. Awktooa decided to act drunk as he once did before, saying he was just looking for the bathroom and got lost. Aric, believes him, and guides him downstairs, while the rest of the cast makes their way up. In response, Tenet releases his snake familiar onto the stairs below, attacking the nearest member of the party, Saphira Drenn. She falls back, being consumed by the poison from the familar. Eramis chooses to stay behind and take care of Saphira, with Marion, Cecilia, Gaius, Gaia, Merida, Aurelian, and Molasses making their way upstairs. Hearing them, Tenet searches for any way to hide, to maintain secrecy to avoid being framed for this murder. To stray attention from Tenet, Aurelian casts Thaumaturgy, making a scream like Valerian's voice, but from a different room. The cast goes there and finds the following item:

A sheath of a dagger, with a familiar family crest.

They then return back to the hallways to search, with Hungar attempting to bash the closet door down, with no luck. Marion uses her key to enter the door, seeing the body of Valerian. The following is found around his body:

A key, with a black wood Finish
A dagger, the one Aric had on his waist

In the meantime, Tenet passes by a room with a red gemstone, but dismisses it. He then finds a room with a busted doorknob, able to be open into. He enters, what seems to be Valerian's personal bedroom. On his desk, a note can be seen written in messy ink, with ink being all over the table. The letter reads:

"My dear Saphira,
I apologize, but I need to do what must be done. There is just too much at stake. I can't handle the guilt anymore. Whatever becomes of us, it will be just, and swift. I love you.

Sincerely,
Valerian Thorne"

Tenet took this, and moves downstairs, where everyone had taken the body of Valerian, and have began the investigation. Tenet shows Saphira the note, and states that she knows that this is not Valerian's handwriting, and knows this cannot be him. She is still ill from the poison. Shortly after this, Awktooa requests to investigate the body of Valerian once more, finding the following:

A reciept of trades from Eramis Frostclaw.

Shortly after this,  they begin to question the other suspects, first being Eramis. He states that he knows that Valerian has made dealings with shady people, but that is all he knows. We then go to Aric. He states that he knew of this as well, and knew that he was going to tell everyone about the dealings he had made. But Valerian did not care, and wanted to go forward with it regardless of Aric's advice. He cries and mourns his friend. As this happens, we begin to see Saphira's body convulse and change, glowing immensely with red magic. This stuns Aurelian, Tenet, and causes Molasses' lantern to glow and vibrate immensely. She poofs into an explosion of red energy, leaving only a note of mysterious runes, with the name, ERAMIS, written at the end, with a sigil of a handprint. Aurelian recognizes these runes, and reads the note aloud.

"Do the mission that has been asked of you. We have trained you well, we expect success more than anyone else. Stray their eyes, no one must know of this. Do it, Eramis."

They show this note to Eramis, and he begins to fidget and stutter, obviously nervous. As all of this is happening, Molasses had made a discovery in the next room, a library, and had announced that he had found a statue of sorts. He then grabs the black box, and hovers it over all the suspects, with Marion's waist moving toward the box, as well as the key that was found off of Valerian's body. You all use the two keys, the one found on Valerian, and the one just found on Marion, to open the black box, to discover:

A mysterious paper, that reads:

"A boy lost, who speaks of pain,
this voice learned, from stone in vain
Land of old, will soon be born,
be our pawn, Valerian Thorne."

As this is read, Eramis Frostclaw beams with rays of red energy and light, an explosion of sorts, unlike anything that came before. Molasses' lantern glows brighter than ever before, vibrating to the point where it hits the ground, Molasses losing grip of it for the first time. Aurelian and Tenet fall to the floor, in more pain than they have ever felt before. Eramis' skin begins to peel from his body, revealing a dark elf in a mysterious cloak, holding a dagger similar to the ones you have discovered. He speaks,

"I was wondering when you all would find the truth, you know. Eramis was always a clumsy fool, leaving too much. Oh well, there's only so much we can do. Pawns, all of you, you all are so small, too foolish to look anywhere other than yourselves. Rats. In a cage. You all will bare witness of what is to come, and witness, the might. Of Radiax."

he opens a portal with his dagger, swiping into the space in front of him, revealing a portal to a different location. Before he enters, he takes a look at Aurelian and Tenet, and states.

"You know.. I can see the resemblence."

He goes through the portal, leaving our characters in shock. The gaurds, who were missing, then run into the mansion, confused and scared. The conspiracy grows evermore.
